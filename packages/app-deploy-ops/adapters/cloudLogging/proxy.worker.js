/*
* adapters/cloudLogging/proxy.worker.js
*
* WEB WORKER side for 'proxy.js'.
*
* Note: Since this is created as a Web Worker, it *does not* have access to the main application's runtime.
*   Try to keep it as self-contained as possible. Dependencies likely get built separately from the main app (including
*   separate tree-shaking; up to how we do it with Rollup).
*
* Batches the log entries, handles things like batch size limit, batch age limit, offline awareness.
*
* DEBUGGING HELP:
*   On Chrome 89, Developer Tools > (right panel) > Threads shows the web worker.
*   - Try the "pause on caught exceptions" - if that is on, you'll automatically get a debugger (also in web worker)
*
*   Note that:
*     - 'debugger' is ignored in web worker!
*     - 'console.log' does not show on console, from web worker!
*     - 'window' does not exist
*
*   [ ] Make more detailed helps in '../../DEVS/Debugging\ Web\ Workers\ (Chrome).md'?
