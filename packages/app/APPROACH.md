# Approach

*This doc is to collect a bit more about the approaches taken.*

## Avoid Cloud Function Callables

In the earlier times of the repo, Cloud Function Callables were used for a couple of things. However, they have one huge drawback: they are not available offline.

FireStore is (it caches data), so the approach is to use Cloud Functions only in the background and do all cloud-client data exchange via Firestore.

When, later, we need to do some more real time dataflow, it's either Firebase Realtime Database or a message bus like PubSub. In such a case, we might need to prepare offline awareness ourselves, into the app. `#speculative`

## No data store

Data is stored distributed, in the `Ref`s around the code. There did not seem to be a need for a centralized data store, Ã  la Vuex.

## Authentication UI

We don't use [Firebase UI](https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-web) (used by maybe 99% of Firebase web projects) but a web component made specifically to replace it.

The reasons are many:

- Firebase UI didn't catch up with ES modules in time
- At 195 kB, Firebase UI is bulky
- It is very badly maintained; not part of the official Firebase web offering (yet crucial)
- It is *waaaaay* overcomplex. The author was not able to compile it from sources, to begin with (!)

In short, the author gave up hope on it ever catching up with modern times.

If features are lacking in the web component, let's build them in there.

>As a side note, the author wonders why browsers don't provide more built-in  support for authentication UI? Something like [Google OneTap for web](https://developers.google.com/identity/one-tap/web/reference/js-reference) on Android. We trust browsers and it would be better to see a native login screen instead of something that can be easily faked in the browser land. If you know the answer, please chime in. ðŸ””


## Component naming convention

Vue.js normally uses `like-this` naming for its components.

We reserve that for externally imported web components, and have our own Vue components `LikeThis`.

Externally imported *Vue* components must be white listed.


## One `local` or two?

Both the Cypress tests (`npm test`) and `npm run dev` want to have local data and users for the emulation. They can work completely offline.

One could separate these, but there's no real benefit from doing so. Our approach is to keep the same local mode for both but differentiate in the data (and users) being loaded.

This might even provide benefits, because you are able to sign in as one of the Daltons, under `npm run dev`.


## Installing Cypress as a dependency

Because:

- It is a versioned tool: this way we can hopefully steer clear of version incompatibilities
- Cypress [recommends](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress.html) doing so.

Cypress does cache the binary parts, across `npm` projects, so the disk space use (about 637MB for Cypress 7.1.0 on macOS) is similar to installing it on the desktop.


## Naming of the Cypress folders

We're trying to stick with the Cypress default conventions.

- tests under `integration` subfolder
- custom commands under `support`

These terms are a bit tedious in our project, though. Could think of:

- `commands` instead of `support`
- `tests` or lifting the tests to the main `cypress` level

Even calling the folder `cypress` is not how the author would like things to be (these are tests; the product matters less), but deviating from conventions of an established tool is also bad.
