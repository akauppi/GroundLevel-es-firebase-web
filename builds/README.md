# Build

This folder contains the guidance for Cloud Build to automatically test and deploy subpackages, when the repo contents are being pushed to the server.

<!-- tbd. explain more -->

>Note: Commands in this document are intended to be executed in the `builds` folder.

## Requirements

- `gcloud` Google Cloud Platform CLI

   Follow [Installing Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
	
	>Note: At least earlier, on macOS, it was best to run the `./google-cloud-sdk/install.sh` in the folder that would remain the install target. 
	>
	>The author has `gcloud` under `~/bin/google-cloud-sdk`.

   ```
   $ gcloud --version
	Google Cloud SDK 332.0.0
	...
   ```

- `docker`
- GNU `make`

   The last two are needed for creating a custom builder.
   
## Build the builder ðŸ‘·ðŸ‘·

We need a Cloud Build builder image that contains:

- `firebase` with emulators
- `npm`
- some command line tools

Such an image is available at [akauppi/firebase-custom-builder](https://github.com/akauppi/firebase-custom-builder). You could clone that repo, but we've already set it up for you as a [Git submodule](https://gist.github.com/gitaarik/8735255) of the [akauppi/firebase-custom-builder](https://github.com/akauppi/firebase-custom-builder) for convenience.

>Submodules are great, but rarely used. This is the first time the author uses them in an open source project.

To build the builder and push it to your Container Registry:

```
$ cd firebase-custom-builder
$ make build push-latest
...
$ cd ..
```

>Note: For more details, and/or contributions, consult the builder's repo stated above.

### Why a custom builder?

There is a [community builder for Firebase](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders-community/tree/master/firebase) but it's no match to what we need.

- no emulation support (no Java) 

Ideally, one of you reading this takes on the challenge of bringing the image we use to the community level. Even then, it is possible that you'd want to curry up some additions to it, as part of your project build chain, so this "building the builder" is not completely in vain.

### Why not host the custom builder image publicly?

Costs. A builder is ~700MB and easily gathers download costs if even 100's of people start pulling it. 

>Note: If you have a solution for this issue, the author is happy to hear!

### How to update the submodule?

Just `cd` into it, and do the normal `git pull`.

### Check the image got pushed

GCP console > `Container Registry` > `Images`:

>![](.images/cr-images-hostname.png)

Note that the "hostname" should be something near you. If you got it wrong, just remove the image and rebuild with another domain.


## Setting up Cloud Build

### 1. Enable GitHub App triggers

- In [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace), enable the "Google Cloud Build" application
- Add your GitHub repo to the Cloud Build app

### 2. Grant Firebase IAM roles to the Cloud Build service account

This allows Cloud Build to use the `firebase` CLI as your project's admin.

- Google Cloud console > `Cloud Build` > `Settings`
- Change `Firebase Admin` to `Enabled`

>![](.images/firebase-admin-enabled.png)


### 3. Add "API Keys Admin" role to the Cloud Build service account

>*Note: [Deploying to Firebase](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/deploying-builds/deploy-firebase) mentions this but the community Firebase builder `README` doesn't. Things might work without it, too?*

- Google Cloud console > `IAM & Admin`
- Spot `@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com` account on the list > <font size="+1.5">`âœŽ`</font> (edit)
- Add the `API Keys Admin` role:

>![](.images/add-api-keys-admin.png)


## Set your `gcloud` project

<!-- Edirot's note: Not sure if this is the best place? 
-->

Using the same project name as with `firebase use`:

```
$ gcloud config set project testing-230321
Updated property [core/project].
```

<!-- disabled (enable if we get problems; for the author Resource Manager APIs were both enabled; normal and "v2"
### Enable GCP APIs

GCP docs state:

>Enable the Cloud Build, Firebase, and Resource Manager APIs.

Check these by:

- GCP Console > Getting Started > `Enable and disable APIs` (you can get there also via the left side menu)
- `Enable APIs and Services` 

  ![](.images/enable-apis-and-services.png)     

This really sucks; there are N APIs for Firebase. Forget it!
-->


## Building locally (optional)

There is a `cloud-build-local` tool that allows one to run Cloud Build scripts, locally. Let's try it!

>Note: The local builder can build on only Linux or macOS.<sub>[source](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/build-debug-locally#restrictions_and_limitations)</sub>

```
$ gcloud components install cloud-build-local
```

We should now be able to run Cloud Builds locally on the repo.

```
$ cloud-build-local -dryrun=true ..
```

The dry run proves that the build configuration looks solid but does not execute the build steps.

### Real build

>Note: If you execute the below command, it will carry on a deployment!

```
$ cloud-build-local -dryrun=false ..
```

**Troubleshooting**

Check the Issues if you have problems with the tool. Especially [Gets stuck during build](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-build-local/issues/79).


## Setting up Triggers

Cloud Build > `Triggers` > `Create Trigger`

Something like this:

>![](.images/trigger-sample.png)

Note: The intention is not to give a 100% working set of properties.

## Manual run

You can trigger new runs (say, for debugging) by the `Run` button under Cloud Build > `Triggers`:

>![](.images/run-trigger.png)


## CI/CD

The author's intention is that the following would happen:

- When someone pushes changes to `master` (or merges a PR to it), and if the changes have to do with `packages/backend/**` (except for `*.md` and documentation images),
  - `npm test` would need to pass, in that folder
  - `npm deploy` would automatically be run; keeping the cloud backend always on-par with `master`

If either of these fails, such a push would fail.

- When someone creates a PR that targets `master`, and (..same conditions on source as above..),
  - `npm test` would need to pass

If that fails, creating such a PR would fail.

---

...and the same, with `packages/app/` and `packages/app-deploy-ops`, with slight modifications.

Note that pushing changes to `packages/app` should trigger deployment, even if the deployment harness (`packages/app-deploy-ops`) is unchanged.


## Maintenance

>Cloud Build does not automatically delete contents in this bucket. To delete objects you're no longer using for builds, you can either set up lifecycle configuration on the bucket or manually delete the objects.

So each build you do (at least using the `gcloud builds submit` command) adds to a pile of sources.

Pay it a visit some day.


## Sum it up

Setting up the *culture* of CI/CD and a working *delivery pipeline* may be the most important things to do *early on*. It should not be hard, and hopefully this page and folder has made it easy for you.

Once you have the road clear, it's motivating to build the product. CI/CD's job is to *reduce the friction* of shipping working features to your audience, for receiving their feedback, in turn.

That sounds important, right?

Now, go build the product!! ðŸ’ªðŸ¤©ðŸŽ‰
