# Build

This folder contains the guidance for Cloud Build to automatically test and deploy subpackages, when the repo contents are being pushed to the server.

<!-- tbd. explain more -->


## Requirements

- `gcloud` Google Cloud Platform CLI

   Follow [Installing Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)

   ```
   $ gcloud --version
	Google Cloud SDK 332.0.0
	...
   ```

	>Note: At least earlier, on macOS, it was best to run the `./google-cloud-sdk/install.sh` in the folder that would remain the install target. 
	>
	>The author has `gcloud` under `~/bin/google-cloud-sdk`.

- `docker` (optional)

   We are using a custom build step. If you develop that further, you might want to have Docker installed.
   
### Set your `gcloud` project

Using the same project name as with `firebase use`:

```
$ gcloud config set project testing-230321
Updated property [core/project].
```

### Build the builder ðŸ‘·ðŸ‘·

Follow the instructions in [akauppi/firebase-custom-builder](https://github.com/akauppi/firebase-custom-builder) (GitHub).

The outcome is an image in *your* Container Registry that can be used for running our tests, under Cloud Build.

Check the image: 

- GCP console > `Container Registry` > `Images`

>![](.images/cr-images-hostname.png)

Note that the "hostname" should be something near you. If you got it wrong, just remove the image and rebuild with another domain.


## Setting up Cloud Build

>tbd. These instructions may not be sufficient. Suggest edits.


### 1. Enable GitHub App triggers

- In [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace), enable the "Google Cloud Build" application
- Add your GitHub repo to the Cloud Build app

### 2. Grant Firebase IAM roles to the Cloud Build service account

This allows Cloud Build to use the `firebase` CLI as your project's admin.

- Google Cloud console > `Cloud Build` > `Settings`
- Change `Firebase Admin` to `Enabled`

>![](.images/firebase-admin-enabled.png)


### 3. Add "API Keys Admin" role to the Cloud Build service account

>*Note: [Deploying to Firebase](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/deploying-builds/deploy-firebase) mentions this but the community Firebase builder `README` doesn't. Things might work without it, too?*

- Google Cloud console > `IAM & Admin`
- Spot `@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com` account on the list > <font size="+1.5">`âœŽ`</font> (edit)
- Add the `API Keys Admin` role:

>![](.images/add-api-keys-admin.png)


## Building manually (optional)

We should now be able to run Cloud Builds locally on the repo.

```
$ gcloud components install cloud-build-local
```

```
$ cloud-build-local dryrun=true ..
```

```
</details>

The dry run proves that the build configuration looks solid but does not execute the build steps.

During a local build, `cloud-build-local` contacts the cloud for getting 
information of your project, but the build itself happens locally. 

**Restrictions:**

>The local builder can build on only Linux or macOS.<sub>[source](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/build-debug-locally#restrictions_and_limitations)</sub>



## CI/CD

```
$ gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild.yaml
```
