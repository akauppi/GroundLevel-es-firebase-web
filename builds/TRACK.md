## Regional builds?

There is a possibility for `--region=europe-west3` in `gcloud [beta] builds submit`, but using such leads to an error:

```
PERMISSION_DENIED: project is not on the allowlist for Regional Cloud Build, please contact Google Cloud Support at https://cloud.google.com/support-hub
```

- [ ] What are regional builds?  Would they be beneficial?
- [ ] How to get a project to the "allowlist"? (check the "support-hub" link in the error message)
