# Troubles(hooting)

## Stuck at "there are left over .."

```
$ cloud-build-local --dryrun=false ..
2021/03/24 16:03:52 Warning: there are left over step containers from a previous build, cleaning them.
```

If this happens to you (and nothing more is output).

```
$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                    PORTS               NAMES

```

Pick the container with `cloudbuild_` in its name.

>*Possibly close and restart Docker.*

```
$ docker container stop cloudbuild_vol_59342577-7885-416e-b3aa-a310d84af208-helper
cloudbuild_vol_59342577-7885-416e-b3aa-a310d84af208-helper
$ docker container rm cloudbuild_vol_59342577-7885-416e-b3aa-a310d84af208-helper
cloudbuild_vol_59342577-7885-416e-b3aa-a310d84af208-helper
