# Runtime environment:
#   - Current directory is '/workspace/...', based on the 'dir' field
#
#   - env.variables (just some):
#     PWD=/workspace
#     HOME=/builder/home
#
# Triggers:
#   - changes in 'packages/backend'

# tbd. app, app-deploy-ops (maybe in separate YAML files??)

# - when push or merge targeting 'master'
#   - if changes in 'packages/backend' (other than '.md' or '.images'):
#     - cd packages/backend
#     - npm install
#     - npm test
#     - npm run deploy

# - when a PR targeting 'master' is being created
#   - if changes in 'packages/backend' (other than '.md' or '.images'):
#     - cd packages/backend
#     - npm install
#     - npm test

# Non-DRY and verbose, since we cannot use '<<: &anchor' and '<<: *anchor' YAML syntax. ðŸ˜¢
#
steps:
# Move pre-downloaded emulator images to where Cloud Build sees them.
# Note: It would be much better if it observed the builder image's own 'HOME', instead.
