## CSS standard support for nesting

https://drafts.csswg.org/css-nesting/

Once implemented in browsers, we don't need the `lang="scss"` any more.

Note: The ideology of the repo is to work close to what plain browsers offer. Thus, no SASS once we can get nesting without it.

Once we have something running with `@exp`, comparison of the before/after bundle sizes is what's interesting.

## npm - what is the point of workspaces?

If they leak all the files through, what's the point?
