# Defines the files *not* sent to Cloud Build.
#
# Note: we could go with the default (that is built by '.gitignore' files), but there
#   are some other, unnecessary paths that don't need to be in the build.

# Default (follow the '.gitignore's):
#
.gcloudignore
.git
.gitignore
#!include:.gitignore

# ^-- Note: '#!include' is a command; not a comment!

# No need for submodules
/.gitmodules

# Global '.gitignore' (of the author); not observed by Cloud Build defaults
#
# The idea has been that not all cruft needs to be in '.gitignore'. Add here globally known editor stuff or similar
# (not project specific).
#
/.idea/
.DS_Store

# Subpackage '.gitignore's
#
# NOTE: These are NOT observed by default by 'gcloud', and the '#!include' syntax does NOT allow paths in subdirectories.
#
# We can live with this. It's still nice to have '.gitignore' in the 'packages/*' subfolders, since they are so
# autonomous. They are the truth - list here should reflect them. If it doesn't, no big harm - just more stuff gets
# shipped at CI/CD builds.
#
# #!include:packages/app/.gitignore
# #!include:packages/app-deploy-ops/.gitignore
# #!include:packages/backend/.gitignore
