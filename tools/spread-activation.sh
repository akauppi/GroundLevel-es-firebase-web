# Spread the same Firebase activation state as in the root folder to the subpackages:
#
#   packages/backend
#   packages/app
#   packages/app-deploy-ops
#
# NOTE: This OVERRIDES any 'firebase use --add' done in those subpackages. On the other hand if a person
#   runs 'firebase use --add' after running this script, they'll end up in an inconsistent state (using different
#   Firebase projects within the different parts of the monorepo).
#
#   For this reason, the 'README' recommends *only* to change the activation at the root level, with an npm script
#   (that calls us).
#
# Usage:
#   <<
#     $ tools/spread-activation.sh
#   <<
#
#if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
#  echo "Usage: $0 version"
#  exit 1

# Using a locally installed 'firebase-tools' over using 'npx firebase-tools' has an advantage. 'npx firebase-tools'
# would prompt for installation from the user, when operating in the subpackages. Also, this allows us to keep track
# of the package version.
