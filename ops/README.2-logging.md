*tbd. instructions on how to set up various ops monitoring and use their consoles*

Deploying an app is like only starting a race.

You want people to find your app, and you want it to remain in good health for them. This is the "ops" (operations) side of things.

The whole layout of this repo is based on enabling different people (or teams) to work on the app and on the ops. These are often conflicting disciplines but it's also very beneficial to take turns in both worlds, whether you are a sole developer or member of a team. The best results are gained by developers who understand operations - and operations people who understand the underlying code.

The [SRE (Site Reliability Engineering)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_reliability_engineering) movement states this wonderfully in one of their books. This is a philosophical realm, too deep to cover here, and well structured in the work you can [read online](https://sre.google/books/). So let's move on! ;)
