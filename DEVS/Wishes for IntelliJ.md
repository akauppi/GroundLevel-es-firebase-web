# Wishes for IntelliJ

*The plugin has become available in the mean time. Should check it out, some day...*

---

Dear IntelliJ. Your IDEs are the best of the breed. I am happy to pay a yearly fee for using WebStorm.

However, recently it has become painfully clear to me that your tool is unfit for editing Firebase Security Rules. The rules are hard, and I *truly* need syntax highlighting for being able to manage them.

Would you help?

Maybe you can talk with Google/Firebase to make this happen?

Microsoft has implemented the grammar, but someone with IntelliJ syntax highlighting experience (and time or funding) should bring it to your products.  Please. 🐶


## Syntax highlight for Firebase Security Rules [IDEABKL-7927]

>NOTE: There's a Security Rules plugin now: [Firebase Rules Syntax Highlighter](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15189-firebase-rules-syntax-highlighter)
>
>- [ ] is it any good?
>- [ ] having versions be "-SNAPSHOT" is worrying (Jan-21)
>- [x] keeping it disabled, until next time working with Rules

>VisualStudio has a plugin for this: https://github.com/toba/vsfire - it would be great to have this in intellij as well.
