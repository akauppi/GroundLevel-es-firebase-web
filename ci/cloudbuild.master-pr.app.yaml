# Trigger:
#   - PR is made or changed; changes affect 'packages/app' or 'packages/app-deploy-ops'
#
# Runtime environment:
#   - Current directory is '/workspace/...', based on the 'dir' field
#
#   - env.variables (just some):
#     PWD=/workspace
#     HOME=/builder/home

substitutions:

  #_CYPRESS_IMAGE: cypress/included:7.4.0

steps:
# Root install
#
# Note: 'patch' (not part of the builder image) must be added and used within the same CI step, since changes outside
#       of '/workspace' don't carry from step to step.
