## Cypress ❤️ Alpine

- [Create a cypress/alpine minimal image](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-docker-images/issues/110)

If we can have Electron run on Alpine, a Cypress CI image could be built on top of `firebase-ci-builder`.

Otherwise, we need two different kinds of images (Debian for Cypress).

- [Alpine Linux support](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/419) (Cypress issues)

This would be the REAL THING!!

- 💥💥 [Run Cypress Headless Without Binary](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1232) 💥💥

>...if we supported Chrome headless (which we will)

- [Separate Electron, Cypress app code, and ffmpeg into individual downloads](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3899)
