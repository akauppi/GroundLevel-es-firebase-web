# Problems!

## `cloud-build-local` fails

```
$ cloud-build-local  --config=cloudbuild.master-pr.backend.yaml --dryrun=false ..
2021/06/11 20:05:14 Warning: The server docker version installed (20.10.7) is different from the one used in GCB (19.03.8)

2021/06/11 20:05:57 Error copying source to docker volume: exit status 1
```

Why does it fail?

Where can one find more logs?

`#contribute`: fix?? :)
